Remote controlled toys (currently just a car) in Minecraft!

Largely inspired by The RC Mod by Sk3rpz for older versions of the game, I felt like this fills a niche that has recieved little attention from the modding community in recent years and fits the 2025 Modfest: Toybox theme perfectly.

## Controls
Right click with a remote controller item to activate and press V to toggle FPV camera mode.
### RC Car
* W: Forwards Acceleration
* S: Backwards Acceleration
